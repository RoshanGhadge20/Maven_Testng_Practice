Maven Build Lifecycle:
1. The Maven build lifecycle consists of the following phases:

validate
compile
test
package
verify
install
deploy
2. The Build phase (mvn compile, mvn test, mvn package, etc.) automates the compilation, testing, and packaging processes.

3. It ensures consistent and reliable builds across different test environments.

4. Maven’s dependency management handles the resolution and integration of external libraries, simplifying the development process.

5. Build reports and test results provide valuable insights into the project’s health and code quality.
