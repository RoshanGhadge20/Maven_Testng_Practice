Key Points:- 
-TestNG is a testing framework for Java that helps automate tests.
-It offers features like annotations, assertions and functionalities for data-driven testing and parallel testing.
-TestNG provides more powerful and flexible functionalities compared to JUnit.
-Common uses include unit testing, integration testing and end-to-end testing.
-You can write test cases in TestNG using annotations and leverage functionalities like parameterization.

Advantages of TestNG:- 
- It provides a powerful and wide variety of annotations to support your test cases.
- Supports parameterized and dependency tests.
- Support for data-driven testing.
- Supported by a variety of tools and plug-ins (Eclipse, IDEA, Maven, etc).
-It helps to perform parallel testing, dependent method testing.
-It offers the flexibility to run your tests through multiple data sets through the TestNG.xml file or via the data-provider concept.
-Test cases can be grouped and prioritized as per need basis.
-Provides access to HTML reports and can be customized through various plugins.
-With its Test logs can be generated across tests.

Advantages of TestNG over JUnit
Flexible Annotations: TestNG provides more flexible annotations for test methods, allowing for better customization and organization of test cases.
Parameterized Tests: TestNG supports parameterized tests, enabling the same test method to be executed with different inputs, enhancing test coverage.
Dependency Management: TestNG allows for specifying dependencies between test methods, ensuring proper test execution order and reducing test flakiness.
Parallel Execution: TestNG supports parallel execution of tests out of the box, improving testing speed and efficiency, which is not as straightforward in JUnit.
XML Configuration: TestNG allows configuration through XML files, providing more control and flexibility in defining test suites and configurations compared to JUnit annotations.
Reporting: TestNG offers comprehensive HTML reports with detailed information on test execution results, making it easier to analyze and debug test failures.

Disadvantages of TestNG?
Setup of TestNG is time-consuming.
If your project does not require test case prioritization that case TestNG is of no use.
In the olden day, it was less commonly used compared to JUnit, so fewer people was having experience with it.
